# Templify Documentation

Welcome to the Templify Documentation! This guide aims to provide comprehensive assistance for developers using Django to build powerful web applications. Whether you're just starting with Django or looking for advanced tips and tricks, you'll find useful information here.

## What is Django?

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It helps developers to build web applications quickly by providing various built-in features such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), URL routing, form handling, authentication, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Django, start by installing it and creating your first project. Follow these steps:

1. Install Django using pip:
    ```
    pip install django
    ```

2. Create a new Django project:
    ```
    django-admin startproject myproject
    ```

3. Navigate into your project directory:
    ```
    cd myproject
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have a basic Django project up and running. You can now explore Django's features and begin building your web application.
